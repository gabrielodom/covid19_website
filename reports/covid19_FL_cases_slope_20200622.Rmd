The data above is COVID-19 hospital census data in Miami-Dade county for all dates with available data since April 2. These columns are: the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (**Hospitalised**), the number of patients in intensive care with COVID-19 (**ICU**), the number of patients in intensive care with COVID-19 who are also on ventilators (**Ventilated**), the number of patients positive for COVID-19 that were admitted the previous day (**AdmitPrevDay**), the number of patients recovered from COVID-19 that were discharged the previous day (**DischPrevDay**), and the net admission of patients positive for COVID-19 the previous day (**DeltaAdmit**; a negative value means more recovered patients were discharged than sick patients admitted). *There is a data error for the count ventilated on the 4th of June; we do not know the true value, but we were told verbally by local Department of Health officials that the data point should be approximately 55 for Miami-Dade. We removed this point from the data before estimating the models shown below.*

```{r pivot_hosp_data}
floridaHospitalised_df[
	floridaHospitalised_df$Date == "2020-06-04",
	"Ventilated"
] <- NA_real_
# There is an error in the original data for June 4th. Rather than deleting the
#   whole row of the raw data, we are skipping this ventilation value

floridaCOVID_df <-
	floridaHospitalised_df %>%
	pivot_longer(
		Hospitalised:DeltaAdmit,
		names_to = "Type",
		values_to = "Count"
	)
```


## Hospital COVID-19 Census
We now show a census plot of hospitalizations, patients in ICU, and those in ICU on ventilators (shown on a log scale):
```{r graph_hosp_counts, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
	data = floridaCOVID_df %>%
		filter(Type != "DischPrevDay") %>%
		filter(Type != "AdmitPrevDay") %>%
		filter(Type != "DeltaAdmit") 
) +

	theme_bw() +
	theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
	aes(x = Date, y = Count, group = Type, colour = Type) +
	scale_color_manual(
		values = c(
			"Ventilated" = "#ff0000",
			"ICU" = "#ff7400",
			"Hospitalised" = "#ffc100",
			"AdmitPrevDay" = "black"
		)
	) +
	scale_y_log10() +
	labs(
		title = "Overall Florida Hospital COVID-19 Census",
		subtitle = paste(
			"State of Florida;",
			format(startEndESS_date[1], "%d %B"),
			"to",
			format(startEndESS_date[2], "%d %B"),
			"2020"
		),
		y = "Counts (Log10 Scale)"
	) +

	geom_point(size = 2) +
	stat_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

Overall, since mid-April, the number of COVID-19 positive patients in Miami-Dade County hospitals has remained constant at around 700 people in hospitals. The COVID-19 ICU census has decreased from its reported peak of 285 on April 17th to around 100 as of June 6th. Overall, the number of COVID-19 patients on ventilators has decreased significantly from its highest point of 192 ventilated on April 22nd to around 60 on June 6th. However, **the observed decreasing trends for ICU census and ventilation census have reversed over the past week**. Note: data is plotted on a log scale.

# Conclusion

Public understanding of science is essential in times of public health crisis. We offer a few closing remarks.

- **The number of positive tests obtained tends to increase as the overall number of tests performed increases.** Simply stated, more tests result in more opportunities for positive results. As an analogy, overall more students will pass a class if more students are enrolled in the class. If we are interested in the difficulty of a course, the percentage of students that pass the class is a better gauge of difficulty than the number of students who pass the class. This is because some classes are large, and some classes are small.
- **Based on the increasing number of COVID-19 tests performed in Miami-Dade County, the proportion of positive tests obtained is the best metric to access COVID-19 epidemic progression.** Overall, the proportion of positive tests obtained has decreased from a high of 20% in early April, to the current rate of between 4-5%. Over the last two weeks, however, the proportion has slightly increased. However, this percentage is still (currently) holding near the 5% threshold recommended by many experts for reopening. Similarly, the number of COVID-19 positive individuals in the hospital, ICU, and on ventilators at the same time has substantially decreased since mid April. However, over the last 2 weeks, the numbers are no longer decreasing, but have seemed to flatten out. From our estimation, hospitals in Miami-Dade County still have sufficient resources to accommodate potential increases.
- **These metrics will change over time based on human behavior.** Because of this, these metrics will be closely monitored to assess the effect of reopening policies.
